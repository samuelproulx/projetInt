# I2C_Lepton
I2C interface for Lepton Camera. This interface is based on the software interface description delivered by FLIR (FLIR_Lepton_Software_Interface_Description_Document_110_0144_03.pdf). The I2C interfaces works. However not all possible commands have been implemented. Also the application does not deliver a userfriendly readout of the data yet.
